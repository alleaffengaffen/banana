# Operating System Config

I deciced to manage this my own and don't use one of the fancy container ready distros out there.

So after cloud-init did a great job of doing most of the required things, just some more checks and things to do for us

## /var dir

Containers take up a lot of space, so make sure `/var` gets as much space as it can get.

I wrote a [guide](https://github.com/the-technat/the-technat/blob/main/content/Kubernetes/lv-extending.md) how to do this with LVM some time ago...

Or if like ubuntu, there is no separaetion between `/var` and `/` we can also skip this step

## Swap

Swap wasn't supported for a long time in K8s history. Nowadays it is but I think more or less experimental. Luckily ubuntu has swap disabled automatically, so we keep this.

## Static IP

This is of course given in hcloud.

## Network Connectivity

Some small checks to see if we can connect to the other hosts.

Use netcat for that:

```bash
nc 167.235.231.30 2379 # should immediately return
nc 167.235.231.30 22222 # should hang until the default timeout is gone
```

## Check containerd config

If should be fill with plenty of lines and running.

## Check packages on hold

kubelet, kubectl and kubeadm should be marked on hold:

```
sudo apt-mark showhold
```
