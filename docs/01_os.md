# Operating System Config

I deciced to manage this my own and don't use one of the fancy container ready distros out there.

So after cloud-init did a great job of doing most of the required things, just some more checks and things to do for us

## Basic setup

Either cloud-init or take a look [here](https://github.com/the-technat/the-technat/blob/main/content/Kubernetes/k8s_kubeadm.md) how this was setup.

## /var dir

Containers take up a lot of space, so make sure `/var` gets as much space as it can get.

I wrote a [guide](https://github.com/the-technat/the-technat/blob/main/content/Kubernetes/lv-extending.md) how to do this with LVM some time ago...

Or if like ubuntu, there is no separaetion between `/var` and `/` we can also skip this step

## Swap

Must be disabled on all nodes. Some already have this, others need to disable it explicitly.

## Static IP

This is of course given in hcloud.

## Check containerd config

If should be fill with plenty of lines and running. Oh and `SystemdCgroup = true` must be set for it to work correctly.

## Check packages on hold

kubelet, kubectl and kubeadm should be marked on hold:

```
sudo apt-mark showhold
```

## Telnet
